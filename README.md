 # First Milestone Project

First milestone project and for this project I have decided to innovate on a current website that is owned by my fathers business
but due to the lack of intuitive and poor layout within the page ( Mismatching colour schemes, poor typography, general inconsistency) I took it as a challenge to improve
it to a way I see fit and to meet the criteria for my project. Link to the study website [Here](https://www.jccookcycles.co.uk/)

# User Experience

The website is targeted to a main demographic of people who are after a new bikes, clothing, servicing and repairs and other various items (lubricants, spare parts etc.) because
of this I need to provide every item with a good amount of useful information that is easy to read and provides a positive user experience, A lot of the main infrastructure needs
a refresh but that's for a later time i.e. Clunky and uninformative checkout and payment processes aswell as an innovative way of allowing customers to book bike repairs and services in the future project.

As I am currently in full time employment within my dads business having the opportunity to interact with the customers has been a great move on my behalf on gathering ideas, tips and
overall improvements that could be made to the website. 

For example: "I tried to fulfill your checkout click and collect form but the payment wouldn't be taken"
 and "Hard to navigate through the website due to too many pages with sparse to little content".


Bugs/Fixes

CSS Stylesheet was not working error code: (Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ). Status: FIXED Solution: Added the "css/.." part to the "style.css" to make it 
"css/style.css" which fixed the issue and enabled the editor to read the stylesheet correctly.

ID's and Class tags sometimes failed to work finally fixed through two methods, clearing the browser cache aswell as editing the classnames due to wrong or mismatched values.

CSS Rules wasnt applying correctly when applying margin values to my newsletter box structure and found a rule that overrided my rules to float to the right: (Fix) Deleted the float: right; style rule and reverted
the override styles.

Bootstrap search bar wasn't applying to widen the element, looked for help online. (https://mdbootstrap.com/support/general/how-to-make-wider-on-navbar-search-text-field/) I managed to find advice here and using style tags managed to apply the styling.
